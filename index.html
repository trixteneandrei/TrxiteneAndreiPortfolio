            <p>Hi, I'm Andrei, a passionate student fascinated by software applications and driven to pursue a career as a Software Engineer specializing in Full-Stack Development, with aspirations for entrepreneurship. From exploring Computer Applications in secondary school to exploring Python coding during my IT-related Nitec course, I've built a strong foundation in problem-solving and creative thinking. I've furthered my coding skills through dedicated online courses, gaining practical skills and deepening my understanding. With a visionary outlook and a thirst for knowledge, I'm determined to make a meaningful contribution to the tech industry as I continue my journey as a student :D</p>

            <img src="Cert1.jpg" alt="Cert1">
            <p>Harvard University's CS50T explores foundational concepts in technology and computer science. It's designed for learners who want to understand how technology shapes our world and how to engage with it effectively. The course covers topics like internet, cybersecurity, web development, and programming. It provides a broad understanding of key technological concepts, making it accessible to those with or without a technical background.</p>

            <img src="Cert2.jpg" alt="Cert2">
            <p>LinkedIn's Intermediate Python for Non-Programmers is the part two of the previous course Python for Non-Programmers, designed specifically for learners with little to no coding experience. Pushed my skill set with more advanced concepts and coding challenges by completing practice projects, including a weather forecaster and web scraper. Learnt more about classes in object-oriented programming as well as functional programming tools and how to create, edit, and delete files. Finishing the course upgraded my toolkit as a developer and I feel more comfortable with Python coding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Cert3">
            <img src="Cert3.jpg" alt="Cert3">
            <p>LinkedIn's Python for Non-Programmers teaches the fundamentals of Python to a non-programmer, users with little to no coding experience. I learnt more about what Python is, and what it is and isnâ€™t used for. Explored how Python works with numbers and how I can interact with simple programs such as a simple number-guessing game. Learnt how to work with text in Python by building a reusable function to count the words in a block of text. And along the way, tackle quick challenges and other games that allow me to put my new skills to the test.</p>

            <img src="Cert4.jpg" alt="Cert4">
            <p>This course gives you insight on how to think like an engineer so that you can feel empowered to create a program, build a website, or even make a mobile app. Software engineer Kathryn Hodge summarizes and analogizes computer science in a simple and logical way as she explains fundamental processes and tools used in programming.</p>

            <p>I created an online marketplace using WordPress as part of a solo project in my module 'Innovation & Enterprise,' which received commendation. The website features a prominent search bar for users to find the food they crave, displaying all listings posted by vendors. It functions as a peer-to-peer platform similar to Carousell, including a messaging feature for communicating with vendors.</p>

            <p>I'm a fan of luxury cars and can only dream of owning one in the future, so I created a website using replit.com. It features Bentley, Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Rolls-Royce cars, each with descriptions. Additionally, there's an 'About' page explaining what we do and why we do it.</p>

            <p>Basketball is a passion of mine, so I drew inspiration to create this game. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move your player around the court and press the space key to shoot the basketball towards the hoop. Navigate carefully to avoid the defender; if she catches up to you, it's game over. The goal is to score as many points as possible by making successful shots while evading the defender's attempts to stop you.</p>

            <p>The code defines a `City` class to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. It creates instances for cities like Tokyo and Portland, printing temperature information in Celsius and Fahrenheit. The `get_data` method fetches weather data, while `temp_print` displays it.</p>
